        <h1>V. Error Neutralization by the Irons Method and Algorithm</h1>
        <p>The essence of the Irons method is as follows: When an error is detected (a symbol is encountered in the input sequence during parsing that does not match any expected symbols), the input sequence of symbols appears as follows: Tt, where T is the next symbol in the input stream (the erroneous symbol), and t is the remaining sequence of symbols in the input stream after T.</p>
        <p>The neutralization algorithm consists of the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the incomplete bushes of the parsing tree;</li>
            <li>Form the set L – the set of residual symbols of the incomplete bushes of the parsing tree;</li>
            <li>Remove the next symbol from the input sequence until the sequence takes the form Tt such that U => T, where U ∈ L, that is, until the next symbol T in the sequence can be derived from one of the residual symbols of the incomplete bushes.</li>
            <li>Determine which of the incomplete bushes caused the symbol U to appear in the set L (in other words, which of the incomplete bushes contains the symbol U).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thus, it is determined to which bush in the parsing tree the remaining input sequence of symbols can be "attached" after removing the erroneous fragment from the text.</p>
